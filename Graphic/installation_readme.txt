III.   INSTALLING THE SOFTWARE
General Installation Notes:
1.  The operating system must be installed prior to the installation of the
    driver.
2.  This installation procedure is specific only to the version of driver
    and installation file included in this release.
3.  This procedure assumes that all of the software associated with this
    release is located in the same directory.
4.	When updating from a non-DCH driver to a DCH driver, Have-Disk
	installation is not recommended, and may leave the system in an unstable state.
	If you are unsure if your drivers are DCH or non, we recommend only
	using igxpin.exe or the extractable EXE to install the driver.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
------------------------------------------------------------------
To install from a Web download, you will download either a .zip file or an
.exe file.
a. If it is a .zip file, double-click on the file you downloaded and choose
   "Extract all files". Browse to a destination folder and choose "Extract".
b. If it is an .exe file, double-click on the file you downloaded and the installer splash screen with pop-up.

------------------------------------------------------------------
  Microsoft Windows* "igxpin.exe" Installation
------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Locate the hard drive directory where the driver files are stored
   using the browser or the Explore feature of Windows*.
2. From this directory, double-click the "igxpin.exe" file.
3. The first dialog of the installation user interface will appear.
4. Click "Next" to continue.
5. Read the License Agreement and, if you agree with the terms,
   click "Yes" to proceed.
6. Review the Readme File information and click "Next" to proceed.
7. When the "Setup Progress" is complete, click "Next" to proceed.
8. When the "Setup is Complete" screen appears, click "Finish" to
   complete the installation. It's recommended to reboot immediately to restart key services, but it is not a requirement.

To determine if the driver has been loaded correctly, refer to the section below.

IV.   VERIFYING INSTALLATION OF THE SOFTWARE
1.  Right click "Start", select "Device Manager".
2.  In the "User Account Control" window, click "Yes".
3.  For Intel(R) Graphics Driver, expand "Display adapters". The Intel(R) Graphics Driver should
    be listed. If not, the driver is not installed correctly.
4.  For Intel(R) Display Audio Driver, expand "Sound, video and game controllers". The "Intel(R) Display
    Audio" driver should be listed and should not show a yellow bang.
    If not, the driver is not installed correctly.

To check the version of the driver, refer to the section below.

V.   IDENTIFYING THE SOFTWARE VERSION NUMBER
Device Manager:
1.  Right click "Start", select "Device Manager".
2.  In the "User Account Control" window, click "Yes".
3.  For Intel(R) Graphics Driver, expand "Display adapters" and double-click the graphics controller. In the "Driver" tab, note the Driver Version.
4.  For Intel(R) Display Audio Driver, expand "Sound, video and game controllers" and double-click "Intel(R) Display Audio". In the "Driver" tab, click "Driver Details" and the function driver (IntcDAud.sys) version should be listed on this screen.

Intel(R) Graphics Command Center:
1.  Click on "Start", search for "Graphics Command Center" and launch the application.
2.  Select the "System" tab on the lefthand side.
3.  Choose the "Driver" header and note the driver version under Graphics Driver.

VI.   INSTALLATION SWITCHES
The switches in the igxpin.exe file will have the following syntax.
Switches are not case-sensitive and may be specified in any order
(except for the -s switch). Switches must be separated by spaces.
SETUP [-b] [-overwrite] [-l<LCID>] [-s] [-report <path>]

GFX-INSTALLATION CUSTOM SWITCHES
-b Forces a system reboot after the installation completes.
In non-silent mode, the absence of this switch will prompt
the user to reboot. In silent mode, the absence of this
switch forces the igxpin.exe to complete without rebooting
(the user must manually reboot to conclude the installation
process).

-overwrite Installs the Intel(R) Graphics Driver regardless of
the version of previously installed driver. In non-silent mode,
the absence of this switch will prompt the user to confirm
overwrite of a newer Intel(R) Graphics Driver. In silent mode,
the absence of this switch means that the installation will
abort any attempts to regress the revision of the Intel(R) Graphics
driver.

-l<LCID> Specifies the language used in the installation user
interface. Without this switch, the installation user interface
will be shown in the Display language of the OS by default.
Hexadecimal values for the supported languages can be found in
the localized language abbreviations section of this readme.

-s Runs in silent mode. The absence of this switch causes
the installation to be performed in verbose mode.

-report <path> Specifies an alternate location for the log file
created by a silent installation. By default, the log file is
created and stored during a silent installation under <root
directory>\Intel\Logs directory as IntelGFX.log
(<WINDIR>\Temp\IntelGFX.log).

VII.   UNINSTALLING THE SOFTWARE
NOTE: This procedure assumes the above installation process
was successful. This uninstallation procedure is specific
only to the version of the driver and installation files
included in this package.

1.  Right click "Start", select "Device Manager".
2.  In the "User Account Control" window, click "Yes".
3.  For Intel(R) Graphics Driver, expand "Display adapters".
4.  Right click the Intel(R) Graphics Driver and select "Uninstall device".
5.  Select the "Delete the driver software for this device" check box and click "Uninstall".
6.  For Intel(R) Display Audio Driver, expand "Sound, video and game controllers".
7.  Right click the Intel(R) Display Audio Driver and select "Uninstall device".
8.  Select the "Delete the driver software for this device" check box and click "Uninstall".
